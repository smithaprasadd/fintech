## 📚 Documentation Guide

### For Understanding the Project
1. **Start here:** Read `PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Comprehensive system design
2. **Then:** Review `DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Phase-by-phase implementation guide
3. **Finally:** Check phase-specific acceptance criteria for testing

### For Development
- **Architecture decisions:** See "System Architecture" in PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Module design:** See "Modular Architecture" section
- **Data flow:** See "Data Flow" diagrams
- **Testing strategy:** See "Testing Strategy" in both documents

### For Viva Preparation
- **Expected questions:** See "Viva Defense Preparation" in PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Technology justification:** See "Technology Stack" explanations
- **Limitations:** See "Known Limitations and Scope"
- **ML explanations:** See "Machine Learning Design"
- **MATLAB integration:** See "MATLAB Analytics Design"

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:
1. **Full-stack development** - React + Flask + MongoDB integration
2. **Machine Learning** - Supervised and unsupervised learning applications
3. **MATLAB integration** - Python-MATLAB interoperability
4. **REST API design** - Modular, scalable architecture
5. **Financial domain knowledge** - Budgeting, risk analysis, investment concepts
6. **Software engineering practices** - Testing, documentation, error handling

---

## ⚠️ Important Scope Notes

### What This IS:
- ✅ Comprehensive college demonstration project
- ✅ Educational tool for understanding financial analytics
- ✅ Portfolio-worthy full-stack application
- ✅ Single-user local application

### What This IS NOT:
- ❌ Production-ready multi-user system (no authentication)
- ❌ Secure for real financial data (no encryption at rest)
- ❌ Professional financial advice (illustrative only)
- ❌ Guaranteed-accurate predictions (ML has limitations)

### MATLAB Integration:
- **Preferred:** MATLAB Engine for Python (requires MATLAB installation)
- **Fallback:** Batch mode CSV processing
- **Graceful:** App works without MATLAB, with clear messaging

### Machine Learning:
- Requires minimum 50 training samples per model
- Accuracy depends on data quality
- Models are educational demonstrations
- Limitations are clearly documented
